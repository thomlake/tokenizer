# tokenizer

## Overview
Tokenize a string.

## Usage
(ns your-namespace
	(:require tokenizer.core))

## Public Functions
(tokenize s split-keep split-ditch)
Scans a string s and returns a vector of tokens in string as specified by split-keep and split-ditch.
split-keep specifies delimeters on which the string should be split, keeping the delimeter as the first character in the next token.
split-ditch specifies delimeters on which the string should be split, throwing away the delimeter.
split-keep and split-ditch can be functions which take a char and return true (split) or false (don't split) or strings of which each character is a delimeter.
Characters are compared first to be disregarded. Keep this in mind if split-keep and split-ditch are not mutually exclusive.

!!!split-keep and split-ditch should be of the same type!!!
This may be changed at some future date, but you have been warned.

## Example
user=>(tokenize "my cat,is!cool" "!," " ")
["my" "cat" "," "is" "!" "cool"]
